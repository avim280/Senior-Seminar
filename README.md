My code generated a schedule for students that places them into 5 sessions at 5 time slots that created the fewest number of conflicts. My approach was to weight the sessions that appeared the most on the students' choices. Then I placed the most common ones at different time slots and repeated the most common ones(making sure to avoid same presentors presenting at the same time). Then I added people to each session(based partly on their choices from first of everyone to 5th of everyone and partly randomly). I had to make sure that a person wasn't placed into a session they were in at a previous time or be placed in two sessions at the same time. To do this, I created a checkContainsSession method in the session class and checkAvailability in the person to make sure that one person didn't attend the same session twice and that one person can't attend two sessions at the same time. I decided to make schedule a 2d arraylist of type session, so that each spot had the sessionName, time, and people in the session. The RedundantSessions method is a part of the AddTheRest method. If a person is supposed to be assigned to a session because they are available and the session isn't full, but they have that session at a previous time, the ReduntantSessions method put them in the previous or latter session at the
timeSlot, remvoing the last person in that timeSlot and switching them to the other session.
